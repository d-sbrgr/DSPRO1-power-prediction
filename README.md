## Project Description

Based on weather, power consumption, holiday and school vacation data, this project aims to predict power consumption in the Swiss city of Zurich. Predictions should be based on weather forecasts with granularity of one hour intervals. Development will be done strictly with past and available data, but a productive implementation will make use of the coming API of meteoswiss (April, 2025).
